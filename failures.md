title: CV of failures
---

**What is this?** A list of things that didn't work out for me.  
I will try to be honest and update this page with
research- and career-related failures as they happen.
The first version was written in 2020 from memory.

**Why is this?** To increase transparency in academia,
in the hope that this will make failures more normal and less painful.  

**Note 1.** This page is inspired by Twitter conversations
about paper rejections and research failures
and [Ben Greenman]({{site.data.links.people.bengreenman.link}})'s CV of failures;
transitively inspired by
[Johannes Haushofer](https://haushofer.ne.su.se/)'s
[CV of failures](https://haushofer.ne.su.se/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures.pdf).

**Note 2.** Many things that work out well involve a great deal of luck.
