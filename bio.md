I was born in 1991 in the city of [Rostov-on-Don](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostov-on-Don), Russia, where I grew up and spent most of my life so far.

In 2008, I finished high school and started a CS undergraduate program at the
{{site.data.links.mdlinks.mmcs}} ({{site.data.links.mdlinks.sfedu}}).
During my undergrad, I got involved in programming languages research
and teaching, thanks to my advisor
[Stanislav Mikhalkovich]({{site.data.links.people.ssm.link}}).
(Stanislav is also the main person behind the teaching programming language
and IDE [PascalABC.NET]({{site.data.links.websites.pascalabc}}),
which is not to be confused with the old Pascal.)
I was lucky to have studied and then worked with several great faculty
who were interested in PL. Special thanks to
[Vitaly Bragilevsky]({{site.data.links.people.vitaly.link}}),
{{site.data.links.mdlinks.artem}},
and [Stanislav Mikhalkovich]({{site.data.links.people.ssm.link}}).

In 2012–2016, I was happily teaching undergraduate CS courses at my alma mater,
{{site.data.links.mdlinks.mmcs}}.  
While teaching half-time, I had entered a PhD program as well, although
later started anew at [Northeastern]({{site.data.links.places.neu.link}}).
(Feel free to ask me about this.)

At the [ECOOP conference in 2016](https://2016.ecoop.org/), I had met
{{site.data.links.mdlinks.janvitek}} who later became my PhD advisor.
I did a research internship with him in Boston in 2017 and then spent a year in
[Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague) as a researcher at the
[Czech Technical University]({{site.data.links.places.cvut.link}}).

In September 2018, I started a PhD in Computer Science
at {{site.data.links.mdlinks.neu}},
and I have been living in Boston since then.
